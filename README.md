# üëã Hi there, I'm Rajendra Behera

I'm Rajendra Behera, a self-taught front-end developer passionate about building modern, responsive web interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap. I love learning by creating real-world projects and continuously improving my skills. I'm currently open to internship and freelance opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and collaborate on exciting web development projects.

I'm currently focused on strengthening my front-end development skills by building mini projects and UI components. I‚Äôm also learning Git for version control and documenting my progress on GitHub and Notion. Alongside this, i am preparing myself for real-world opportunities like internships or freelance projects.
