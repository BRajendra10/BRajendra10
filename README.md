# 👋 Hi there, I'm Rajendra Behera

I’m a passionate **Front-End Developer** who loves building clean, responsive, and interactive web applications. I specialize in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery** — and I’m always exploring new ways to bring ideas to life on the web.

Currently leveling up my front-end journey with hands-on projects, deep dives into core web technologies, and refining my problem-solving through platforms like LeetCode.
