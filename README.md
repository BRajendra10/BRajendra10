# Rajendra Behera

Hi, I’m Rajendra Behera — a self-taught front-end developer passionate about crafting modern, responsive, and accessible web interfaces. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, React, Git, and Vite, and I enjoy building real-world projects that challenge me to improve my skills and learn new tools.

I’m currently focusing on improving my React skills and learning how to build scroll-based and trigger-based animations to make modern websites more interactive and engaging. My goal is to become a better developer by creating meaningful projects, mastering advanced UI techniques, and working in a full-time job or internship where I can learn from others, collaborate on real projects, and deliver high-quality work.
