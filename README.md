# Rajendra Behera

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Rajendra Behera ‚Äî a self-taught front-end developer currently learning full-stack web development. I‚Äôm passionate about creating modern, responsive, and accessible web interfaces, and I love turning ideas into interactive experiences.

I‚Äôve built a strong foundation in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, React, and Redux. Alongside these, I actively use tools like Git, Vite, and other modern utilities to streamline my development workflow. By building and refining real-world projects, I‚Äôve strengthened my expertise in responsive design, user interface development, and interactive experiences ‚Äî equipping me to contribute effectively to professional projects and collaborative environments. 

I‚Äôm looking for an opportunity as a front-end developer to contribute to impactful projects and advance my expertise in modern web development.
